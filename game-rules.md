# RISK: The World Conquest Game

Risk is a strategy board game of diplomacy, conflict and conquest for three to six players.

## Introduction

In this classic game of military strategy, you are battling to conquer the world. To win, you must launch daring attacks, defend yourself on all fronts, and sweep across vast continents with boldness and cunning. But remember, the dangers, as well as the rewards, are high. Just when the world is within your grasp, your opponent might strike and take it all away!

### Strategy

In all the RISK games, keep these 3 strategy hints in mind as you play, add armies, and fortify:

1. Conquer whole continents: You will earn more armies that way.
1. Watch your enemies: If they are building up forces on adjacent territories or continents, they may be planning an attack. Beware!
1. Fortify borders adjacent to enemy territories for better defense if a neighbor decides to attack you.

### The Game Board

The game board is a map of 6 continents divided into 42 territories. Each continent is a different color and contains from 4 to 12 territories. The numbers in the chart in the lower left-hand corner of the board indicate the number of armies you will receive for a set of cards you trade in, as explained below.

### RISK Cards

There are 42 RISK cards, each marked with the name of a territory and one of three icons: ⚒, ⚓, and ⚔. In addition, there are 2 wildcards marked with all three icons, but no territory.

## Object of the Game

To conquer the world by occupying every territory on the board, thus eliminating all your opponents.

## Setup

Unlike most games, RISK demands careful planning before you actually start to play. This Initial Army Placement sets the stage for the battles you’ll fight later on.

### Initial Army Placement

Each player is assigned a color and, depending on the number of players, receives a set number of "armies" to start the game.

- 3 Players = 35 armies
- 4 Players = 30 armies
- 5 Players = 25 armies
- 6 Players = 20 armies

The order in which players take their turns will be randomly determined at the beginning of the game.

Each player in turn places one army onto any unoccupied territory. Continue until all 42 territories have been claimed.

After all 42 territories are claimed, each player in turn places one additional army onto any territory he or she already occupies. Continue in this way until everyone has run out of armies. There is no limit to the number of armies you may place onto a single territory.

## Playing

On your turn, try to capture territories by defeating your opponents’ armies. But be careful: Winning battles will depend on careful planning, quick decisions, and bold moves. You’ll have to place your forces wisely, attack at just the right time and fortify your defenses against all enemies.

**Each of your turns consists of three steps, in this order:**

1. Getting and placing new armies;
1. Attacking, if you choose to;
1. Fortifying your position.

### Getting and Placing New Armies

At the beginning of each turn, the number of new armies you can add to your territories is calculated based on...

1. The number of territories you occupy;
1. The value of the continents you control;
1. The value of the matched sets of RISK cards you trade in;
1. The specific territory pictured on a traded-in card.

#### Territories

At the beginning of every turn (including your first), the total number of territories you currently occupy is divided by three (ignoring any fraction) to determine number of armies you receive. New armies can be placed on any territory you already occupy.

Example:

- 11 territories = 3 armies
- 14 territories = 4 armies
- 17 territories = 5 armies

You will always receive at least 3 armies on a turn, even if you occupy fewer than 9 territories.

#### Continents

In addition, at the beginning of your turn you will receive armies for each continent you control. (To control a continent, you must occupy all its territories at the start of your turn.) To find the exact number of armies you’ll receive for each continent, look at the chart in the lower left-hand corner of the game board.

#### Earning Cards

At the end of any turn in which you have captured at least one territory, you will earn one (and only one) RISK card. You are trying to collect sets of 3 cards in any of the following combinations:

- 3 cards with the same icon (⚒, ⚓, or ⚔)
- 1 each of all three 3 icons
- 2 different icons plus a wildcard

If you have collected a set of 3 RISK cards, you may turn them in at the beginning of your next turn, or you may wait. But if you have 5 or 6 cards at the beginning of your turn, you **must** trade in at least one set, and may trade in a second set if you have one.

#### Trading In Cards for Armies

At the beginning of subsequent turns, you may trade in matched sets of cards and take additional armies based on the total number of sets anyone has traded in so far.

- The first set traded in - 4 armies
- The second set traded in - 6 armies
- The third set traded in - 8 armies
- The fourth set traded in - 10 armies
- The fifth set traded in - 12 armies
- The sixth set traded in - 15 armies

After the sixth set has been traded in, each additional set is worth 5 more armies.

Example: If you trade in the seventh set, you get 20 armies; if you trade in the eighth, you get 25 armies, and so on. “First” and “second” set, etc., refer to sets traded in by anyone during the game. Thus, if you trade in the third set in the game, you receive 8 armies, even if it’s the first set you have traded in.

##### Occupied Territories

If any of the 3 cards you trade in has the name of a territory you occupy, you receive 2 extra armies. You must place both those armies onto that particular territory.

Note: On a single turn, you may receive no more than 2 extra armies above and beyond those you receive for the matched sets of cards you trade in.

Tip: No matter how many armies you receive at the start of your turn, deploy them carefully-either to prepare for an attack or to defend against one. It is good military strategy to move your armies to the front, heavily fortifying territories that border enemy territories

### Attacking

After placing your armies at the beginning of your turn, decide if you wish to attack at this time. The object of an attack is to capture a territory by defeating all the opposing armies already on it. The battle is fought by a roll of the dice. Study the board for a moment. Do you want to attack?

If you choose not to attack, the next player begins their turn.

If you choose to attack, you must follow these rules:

- You may only attack a territory that is adjacent to one of your own, or connected to it by a dashed line. Examples: Northern Schataria may attack the Gilatian Isles, Travaria, Azealon, and Shalathra. Southern Arillia may attack Southern Arlas, Western Arillia, Inghal, Aroya, and Velis. At the western and eastern edges of the board, The Kingdom of the Sun is considered adjacent to, and may attack, Azure Kingdom.
- You must always have at least two armies in the territory you are attacking from.
- You may continue attacking one territory until you have eliminated all armies on it, or you may shift your attack from one territory to another, attacking each as often as you like and attacking as many territories as you like during one turn.

#### To Attack

First select the territory you are attacking and then the one you are attacking from. Select the number of armies you will attack with (up to 3), and dice will be rolled against the opponent who occupies the opposing territory.

- You, the attacker, will roll 1, 2 or 3 red dice: You must have at least one more army in your territory than the number of dice you roll.
- The defender will roll either 1 or 2 white dice: To roll 2 dice, he or she must have at least 2 armies on the territory under attack.

Tip: The more dice you roll, the greater your odds of winning. Yet the more dice you roll, the more armies you may lose, or be required to move into a captured territory.

#### To Decide a Battle

The highest die each combatant rolled is compared. If yours (the attacker’s) is higher, the defender loses one army from the territory under attack. But if the defender’s die is higher, you lose one army from the territory you attacked from. If each of you rolled more than one die, the two next-highest dice are compared in the same way.

* In the event of a tie, the defender always wins.
* The attacker can never lose more than 2 armies on a single roll.

#### Capturing Territories

As soon as you defeat the last opposing army on a territory, you capture that territory and must occupy it immediately. To do so, move in at least as many armies as the number of dice you rolled in your last battle. Remember: In most cases, moving as many armies as you can to the front is advantageous, because armies left behind can’t help you when you are attacking. Also remember you must always leave at least one army behind on the territory you attacked from. During the game, every territory must always be occupied by at least one army.

#### Ending Your Attack

You may end your attack(s) at any time. If you have captured at least one territory, you will be awarded a RISK card. (No matter how many territories you’ve captured on your turn, you will only receive one RISK card.) Your last step is to fortify your position, if you wish (see below).

#### Eliminating An Opponent

If during your turn you eliminate an opponent by defeating his or her last army on the game board, you win any RISK cards that player has collected.

- If winning them gives you 6 or more cards, you must immediately trade in enough sets to reduce your hand to 4 or fewer cards, but once your hand is reduced to 4,3, or 2 cards, you must stop trading
- But if winning them gives you fewer than 6, you must wait until the beginning of your next turn to trade in a set.
- When you draw a card from the deck at the end of your turn (for having won a battle), if this brings your total to 6, you must wait until your next turn to trade in.

### Fortifying Your Position

No matter what you’ve done on your turn, you may, if you wish, end your turn by fortifying your position. You are not required to win a battle or even to try an attack to do so. Some players refer to this as the “free move.”

To fortify your position, move as many armies as you’d like from one (and only one) of your territories into one (and only one) of your adjacent territories. Remember to move troops towards borders where they can help in an attack!

In moving your armies from one territory to another, you must leave at least one army behind.

### Winning

The winner is the first player to eliminate every opponent by capturing all 42 territories on the board.
